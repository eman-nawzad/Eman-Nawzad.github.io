## 🌟 Featured Projects  

### 1. [Drought Monitoring System 🚰](https://github.com/eman-nawzad/Drought-Monitoring)  
**Description**:  
This project focuses on drought monitoring by leveraging the **Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI)** to analyze precipitation anomalies. The system provides critical insights for managing water resources and mitigating drought impacts.  

**Features**:  
- Automated SPI computation using satellite rainfall data  
- Geospatial visualization of drought conditions across regions  
- Insights for policy-making and agricultural resource management

### 2. [Streamlit Applications 🌐](#)  
I have developed Streamlit web applications to make geospatial data and analysis more accessible. These applications showcase dynamic maps, analytical dashboards, and easy-to-use interfaces for exploring geospatial data.

#### Key Streamlit Applications:  

 **Drought Monitoring App**  
   - Displays SPI drought maps and categorized drought severity using an interactive interface.  
   - Features include zoomable maps, SPI thresholds, and a legend for easier interpretation.
