## 🌟 Featured Project: Drought Monitoring System 🚰  
### [View Repository](https://github.com/eman-nawzad/Drought-Monitoring)

**Overview**:  
This project focuses on drought monitoring by leveraging the **Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI)** to analyze precipitation anomalies. The system provides critical insights for managing water resources and mitigating drought impacts.

**Key Features**:  
- Automated SPI computation using satellite rainfall data  
- Geospatial visualization of drought conditions across regions  
- Insights for policy-making and agricultural resource management  

**Streamlit App**:  
An interactive application designed for exploring SPI drought maps.  
- Displays categorized drought severity using intuitive maps.  
- Features zoomable maps, SPI thresholds, and legends for better interpretation.
